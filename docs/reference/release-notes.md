# Hedgehog Release Notes

> **Note:** This page summarizes Hedgehog Fabric and Fabricator releases, versioning scheme, and upgrade compatibility. For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrading Hedgehog Fabric](../how-to/upgrading.md).

---

## Versioning Scheme

Hedgehog uses a CalVer-style versioning system as of December 2024:

- `YY.MINOR.PATCH` where:
  - `YY`: short calendar year (24, 25, 26)
  - `MINOR`: zero-padded release number in the year (01, 02, 03)
  - `PATCH`: patch number for a release (1, 2, 3)

Example: `25.01` is the first release of 2025; `25.01.1` is its first patch.

API backward compatibility and in-place upgrades are guaranteed starting with the B1 release (Oct 24 2024).
Some new features may require manual intervention or a fresh install; such cases are explicitly noted in the release notes.
