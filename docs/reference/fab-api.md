## Overview

The Hedgehog Fabric CLI is provided as a `kubectl` plugin: `kubectl fabric`.
This tool simplifies the management of Fabric resources in Kubernetes environments.
It wraps `kubectl` and the Kubernetes client, providing user-friendly commands for key Fabric operations.

> **Security Notice:**
> Some CLI commands (e.g., `power-reset`, `wipe`) may disrupt fabric operations or alter network state.
> Only run these commands in trusted environments and with appropriate permissions. See [Security Model](../explanation/security-model.md).
