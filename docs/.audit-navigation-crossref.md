## Navigation Entries Pointing to Non-Existent Files

- None found (all nav entries appear to point to existing files)

## Files That May Need Re-Categorization or User Decision

- user-guide/profiles.md: Listed in both directory and navigation, check for duplication or misplacement.
- reference/profiles.md: Not in navigation, but may be valuable for reference section.
- how-to/deploying-fabric.md: Not in navigation, but likely important as a how-to guide.
- troubleshooting/overview.md: Not in navigation, but could be a valuable section or landing page under How-to or FAQ.
- known-limitations/known-limitations.md: Not in navigation, consider adding under FAQ or a dedicated "Known Limitations" section.
- release-notes/index.md: Not in navigation, but may duplicate reference/release-notes.md; confirm if both are needed.
- vlab/demo.md and vlab/overview.md: Not in navigation, consider if these should be under Tutorials or a new VLAB section.

## Recommendations

- Review and add missing but valuable files to navigation.
- Remove or merge duplicates.
- Re-categorize files for Diátaxis compliance where necessary.
- Confirm with user for ambiguous cases (e.g., duplicate or legacy files).

**Next Steps:**
- Review this report and provide feedback or decisions on ambiguous files.
- Upon approval, I will update `mkdocs.yml` to reflect the agreed changes and ensure all valuable documentation is discoverable and organized according to Diátaxis principles.
