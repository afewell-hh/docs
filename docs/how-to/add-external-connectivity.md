# How to Add External Connectivity to a Hedgehog Fabric VPC

> **Warning:**
> Exposing a VPC to external networks (WAN, internet, or other clouds) increases security risk.
> Validate all policies and review security considerations before proceeding.
> Review [Security Model](../explanation/security-model.md) and [Release Notes](../reference/release-notes.md) for version-specific and security-impacting changes.

## Concept: Border Leaf and Edge Integration

Traffic exits from the Fabric on Border Leaves connected to Edge devices. Border Leaves:
- Terminate L2VPN connections
- Distinguish VPC L3 routable traffic toward Edge devices
- Land VPC servers

> **Note:** External Peering is only available on switch devices capable of sub-interfaces.

### Edge Device Requirements
- Set up BGP IPv4 to advertise/receive routes from the Fabric
- Connect to a Fabric Border Leaf over VLAN
- Mark egress routes toward the Fabric with BGP Communities
- Filter ingress routes from the Fabric by BGP Communities

### Concept: Control Plane: BGP Peering

The Fabric shares VPC routes with Edge devices via BGP. Peering is done over VLAN in IPv4 Unicast AFI/SAFI.

### Concept: Data Plane: VLAN Tagging

VPC L3 routable traffic is tagged with VLAN and sent to the Edge device. Further processing (e.g., NAT, PBR) is performed on the Edge.

### Filter and Policy Examples

Each VPC can be allowed to access Edge devices. Filtering can be applied to routes exported to or imported from Edge devices. Example:
```yaml
spec:
  permit:
    external:
      name: ###
      prefixes:
      - prefix: 0.0.0.0/0 # allow default route
```

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to configure external peering for Hedgehog Fabric
- Connect Border Leaf switches to Edge devices for L3 connectivity
- Apply BGP and VLAN configuration for route exchange
- Enforce filtering and policies for VPC traffic to/from Edge
- Create and apply Kubernetes resources (External, Connection, ExternalAttachment, ExternalPeering)
- Validate and troubleshoot connectivity

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the Hedgehog Control Node with `kubectl fabric` installed
- Sufficient privileges to manage external resources
- Knowledge of the target VPC and external network details (e.g., VLAN, subnet, gateway)
- Review [Security Model](../explanation/security-model.md) and [VPC Peering](../explanation/vpc-peering.md)
- Confirm device compatibility ([Supported Devices](../reference/supported-devices.md))

## Step 1: Define the External Resource

1. Create an external resource in Fabric:
   ```bash
   kubectl fabric external create --name ext-wan --vlan 2000 --subnet 192.0.2.0/24 --gateway 192.0.2.1
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   [INFO] External resource 'ext-wan' created with VLAN 2000, subnet 192.0.2.0/24, gateway 192.0.2.1
   ```
   - Replace VLAN/subnet/gateway with your external network parameters.
2. Inspect the external resource:
   ```bash
   kubectl fabric inspect external --name ext-wan
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   NAME      VLAN   SUBNET         GATEWAY      STATUS
   ext-wan   2000   192.0.2.0/24   192.0.2.1    Ready
   ```

---

## Step 2: Attach VPC to External Resource

1. Attach the VPC to the external connection:
   ```bash
   kubectl fabric vpc attach --vpc-subnet vpc-1/default --connection ext-wan--leaf-01
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   [INFO] VPC 'vpc-1' attached to external connection 'ext-wan--leaf-01'
   ```
   - Use the appropriate connection string for your topology.
2. Validate attachment:
   ```bash
   kubectl fabric inspect vpc --name vpc-1
   kubectl fabric inspect connection --name ext-wan--leaf-01
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   CONNECTION NAME      STATUS      ...
   ext-wan--leaf-01     Ready       ...
   ```

---

## Step 3: Configure External Peering (API Example)

Use the [Fabric API Reference](../reference/fabric-api.md#external) or apply the following manifests:
```bash
kubectl apply -f external.yaml
kubectl apply -f connection.yaml
kubectl apply -f external-attachment.yaml
kubectl apply -f external-peering.yaml
```

## Step 4: Validate Connectivity

1. From a server in the VPC, test external reachability:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it server-01 -- ping 192.0.2.1
   kubectl exec -it server-01 -- curl http://example.com
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   PING 192.0.2.1 (192.0.2.1): 56 data bytes
   64 bytes from 192.0.2.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.23 ms
   ...
   curl: (6) Could not resolve host: example.com  # if DNS/firewall is not configured
   ...
   ```
2. Check routing and interface configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it server-01 -- ip route
   kubectl exec -it server-01 -- ip addr
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   default via 192.0.2.1 dev eth0
   ...
   ```

If connectivity fails, see [Troubleshooting External Connectivity](./troubleshooting-fabric.md#external-connectivity).

## Rollback: Detach VPC or Delete External Resource

If you need to remove external connectivity:

1. Detach the VPC:
   ```bash
   kubectl fabric vpc detach --vpc-subnet vpc-1/default --connection ext-wan--leaf-01
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   [INFO] VPC 'vpc-1' detached from external connection 'ext-wan--leaf-01'
   ```
2. Delete the external resource:
   ```bash
   kubectl fabric external delete --name ext-wan
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```console
   [INFO] External resource 'ext-wan' deleted
   ```
