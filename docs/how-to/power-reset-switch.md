# How to Safely Power-Reset a Switch Using the Hedgehog Fabric CLI

> **Warning:**
> Power-resetting a switch is a disruptive, potentially destructive operation.
> Only perform this action with a full understanding of its consequences.
> Always validate the target switch and confirm network impact before proceeding.
> Review [Release Notes](../reference/release-notes.md) and [CLI Reference](../reference/fabric-cli.md#switch-sw) for version-specific and security-impacting changes.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to a Hedgehog Control Node with `kubectl fabric` installed
- Sufficient privileges to execute power operations
- Knowledge of the target switch name ([Inspecting Switches](../reference/fabric-cli.md#inspect-i))
- Review [Supported Devices](../reference/supported-devices.md) for compatibility

## Step 1: Identify the Target Switch

List all switches and find the exact name of the device you wish to reset:

```bash
kubectl fabric switch get
```

Or, for detailed information:

```bash
kubectl fabric inspect switch --name <switch-name>
```

## Step 2: Validate Impact and Confirm

- Review the current switch status and dependencies (e.g., VPCs, connections).
- Communicate with affected users or teams.
- Consider maintenance windows or redundancy.
- Review [Architecture Overview](../explanation/architecture.md) for network impact.

## Step 3: Execute the Power-Reset Command

```bash
kubectl fabric switch power-reset --name <switch-name>
```

Sample confirmation prompt:

```console
WARNING: You are about to power-reset switch '<switch-name>'. This will interrupt all connected workloads.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]: y
[INFO] Power-reset initiated for switch '<switch-name>'.
```

- You will be prompted to confirm the operation.
- The switch will lose power and reboot. All connected workloads will be interrupted.

> **Note:**
> The `power-reset` command may behave differently depending on your Hedgehog release.
> See [CLI Reference: switch power-reset](../reference/fabric-cli.md#switch-sw) and [Release Notes](../reference/release-notes.md) for version-specific details.

## Step 4: Monitor and Validate Recovery

After issuing the reset, monitor the switch status:

```bash
kubectl fabric inspect switch --name <switch-name>
```

Sample output:

```console
NAME          STATUS      UPTIME      ...
<switch-name> Ready       00:02:13    ...
```

- Wait for the switch to return to a `Ready` or `Operational` state.

If the switch does not recover or the command fails, see [Troubleshooting Switch Recovery](./troubleshooting-fabric.md#switch-recovery).
