title: Getting Started
version: Hedgehog v1.0.0
type: Tutorial
---

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through your first experience with Hedgehog Fabric, from obtaining access to running your first virtual lab (VLAB) simulation. No prior experience with Hedgehog is assumed.

---

## 1. Requesting Access to Hedgehog

Before you begin, you need access credentials:

1. Go to the [Hedgehog Support Portal](https://support.githedgehog.com/).
2. Submit a request for access to Hedgehog Fabricator (`hhfab`).
3. Wait for your credentials for the [GitHub Package Registry](https://ghcr.io).

---

## 2. Preparing Your System

**Supported platforms:**
- Linux x86/arm64 (Ubuntu 24.04 recommended)
- macOS x86/arm64 (installer only)
- Windows WSL2 (not officially tested)

**Required tools:**
- Docker
- ORAS
- QEMU/KVM (Linux, for VLAB)

**Install Docker (Linux):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
sudo sh install-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

**Install QEMU/KVM (Linux):**
```bash
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm socat
```

**Install ORAS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/oras | bash
```

---

## 3. Downloading and Installing the CLI

**Authenticate with GitHub Package Registry:**
```bash
docker login ghcr.io --username <provided_user_name> --password <provided_token_string>
```

**Download and install `hhfab`:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/hhfab | bash
```

- For a specific version:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/hhfab | VERSION=24.09 bash
  ```
- To change the install location:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/hhfab | INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/bin bash
  ```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
hhfab --version
```

---

## 4. Initializing and Running Your First VLAB

1. **Initialize configuration:**
   ```bash
   hhfab init --dev
   ```
   This creates a `fab.yaml` config file.

2. **Generate the default VLAB topology:**
   ```bash
   hhfab vlab gen
   ```
   This creates `vlab.generated.yaml` for the default topology.

3. **Customize topology (optional):**
   - Edit `fab.yaml` for Collapsed Core mode:
     ```yaml
     mode: collapsed-core
     ```
   - Or generate with custom flags:
     ```bash
     hhfab vlab gen --mclag-leafs-count 4 --orphan-leafs-count 2
     ```

4. **Start VLAB:**
   Follow instructions in [Running VLAB](../vlab/running.md) for next steps.

---

## 5. Validating Your Virtual Lab

Check VM and fabric status:
```bash
hhfab vlab status
```

- All VMs should be `running`.
- Review logs for errors:
  ```bash
docker ps
docker logs <container-id>
  ```

---

## 6. Creating and Attaching a VPC

Use the Hedgehog Fabric CLI to create a VPC:
```bash
kubectl fabric vpc create --name vpc-1 --subnet 10.0.1.0/24 --vlan 1001 --dhcp --dhcp-range-start 10.0.1.10
```

Attach the VPC to a server connection:
```bash
kubectl fabric vpc attach --vpc-subnet vpc-1/default --connection server-01--mclag--leaf-01--leaf-02
```

---

## 7. Validating Connectivity

Log into a server and check network interfaces:
```bash
kubectl exec -it server-01 -- bash
ip addr
```

- Check for the expected IP addresses and VLAN interfaces.

---

## 8. Cleaning Up

To remove demo resources:
```bash
kubectl delete -f vpc-1.yaml
```

Or use the VLAB utility for bulk cleanup:
```bash
hhfab vlab down
```
