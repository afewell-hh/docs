# Getting Started: Deploy Your First Virtual Lab with Hedgehog Fabric

Welcome! This tutorial will guide you through deploying your first virtual lab (VLAB) using Hedgehog Fabric.
No prior experience is required—every step is explained in detail.

> **Security Warning:**
> When using `curl | bash` to install software, always review the script before running it.
> Download scripts from trusted sources only. See the [Hedgehog Fabricator installer](../getting-started/download.md) for more details.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux or macOS system (Windows users: see [platform notes](../known-limitations/known-limitations.md))
- Access to the Hedgehog Fabricator installer (`hhfab`) ([Download instructions](../getting-started/download.md))
- [ORAS](https://oras.land/) installed for pulling binaries
- Docker and QEMU/KVM installed (for virtualization)

> **Tip:** If you are using a Hedgehog Control Node, most requirements are pre-installed.

---

## 1. Download and Install Hedgehog Fabricator

```bash
curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/hhfab | bash
```

- To install a specific version:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/hhfab | VERSION=24.09 bash
  ```

- To change the install location:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://i.hhdev.io/hhfab | INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/bin bash
  ```

Verify installation:
```bash
hhfab --version
```

---

## 2. Initialize Lab Configuration

Generate a default configuration file:

```bash
hhfab init --dev
```

This creates `fab.yaml` with sensible defaults for lab use.

---

## 3. Generate VLAB Topology

Create a default virtual topology:

```bash
hhfab vlab gen
```

- This creates `vlab.generated.yaml` (spine-leaf topology).
- For custom topologies, see [Advanced Topology](../vlab/overview.md).

---

## 4. Start the Virtual Lab

Launch the lab environment:

```bash
hhfab vlab up
```

- Add `--kill-stale` to remove old VMs:
  ```bash
  hhfab vlab up --kill-stale
  ```
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all VMs.

---

## 5. Validate Lab Status

Check VM and fabric status:

```bash
hhfab vlab status
```

- All VMs should be `running`.
- Review logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  docker logs <container-id>
  ```

---

## 6. Create and Attach a VPC

Use the Hedgehog Fabric CLI to create a VPC:

```bash
kubectl fabric vpc create --name vpc-1 --subnet 10.0.1.0/24 --vlan 1001 --dhcp --dhcp-range-start 10.0.1.10
```

Attach the VPC to a server connection:

```bash
kubectl fabric vpc attach --vpc-subnet vpc-1/default --connection server-01--mclag--leaf-01--leaf-02
```

> **See Also:** [CLI Reference: VPC](../reference/fabric-cli.md#vpc-vpc)

---

## 7. Validate Connectivity

Log into a server and check network interfaces:

```bash
kubectl exec -it server-01 -- bash
ip addr
```

- Check for the expected IP addresses and VLAN interfaces.

---

## 8. Clean Up

To remove demo resources:

```bash
kubectl delete -f vpc-1.yaml
```

Or use the VLAB utility for bulk cleanup:

```bash
hhfab vlab down
```
